The song should sound like a catchy children's singalong for ages 2-6.

Musical style:
{{STYLE}}

Requirements:
- warm, playful, memorable, positive
- easy to sing along
- short chantable chorus
- tell a tiny preschool story: problem → discovery → fun → celebration
- match the musical style above exactly (if lullaby/bedtime, keep it soft and quiet — no marching band energy)

Production:
- ukulele or acoustic guitar or soft piano
- soft percussion (quiet for bedtime)
- light hand claps only if the song is upbeat

Keep the song SHORT.

Finish with a brief instrumental outro (about 5 seconds).

Vocals should finish before the music ends.

Do not cut off abruptly.

Target runtime:
about 75 seconds.`;

export const KIDS_HIT_LYRICS_PROMPT = `You are a preschool hit songwriter for ages 2-6.

Write a SHORT home singalong (about 75 seconds when sung) as ONE tiny lived adventure — characters DOING things to each other and the world, never a pose checklist.

Theme (ONLY this — must happen at home / yard / kitchen / bedroom):
{{THEME}}

Educational focus (light touch):
{{EDU_FOCUS}}

Primary chorus movement (must appear clearly in every chorus):
{{MOVEMENT}}

Mood: {{MOOD}}

ONE OBJECTIVE (required):
The whole song has ONE goal a toddler can say out loud (examples: march inside because rain; wash hands then eat; find teddy for bed; tidy toys; morning stretch with Mom).
Write it on the first line after TITLE as:
OBJECTIVE: ...

LIVED CHAIN (required — each line is a CAUSE of the next):
Write what characters NOTICE and DO, not frozen poses.
Good: stuck in sheets → Mom kneels nearby → I look up → Mom waves open arms → I stretch → we dance side by side → ready
Bad: stand → wave → stand → smile → stand
NEVER write hugs, kisses, embraces, holding, wrapping arms, hand-holding, high-fives, cheek-to-cheek, or "pull close" — kids-safe near-space play only (look, wave, kneel nearby, clap, point, stretch, dance beside).

MINI STORY ARC (escalate energy):
1. PROBLEM (Intro) — stuck / can't / oh no (soft, small)
2. DISCOVERY (Verse 1) — notice helper or idea; look → try
3. FUN (Chorus) — bigger motion; peak on second chorus
4. MORE FUN (Verse 2) — same objective, one new twist
5. CELEBRATION (Outro) — smile / wave / done (warm resolve) — NO hug

HARD RULES:
- Setting must be depictable in: kitchen, kitchen_sink, lawn, bedroom, home, dining_room, playroom, backyard, bathtub, porch, living_rug (doorways connect rooms)
- Name places in travel order (bed → door → rug)
- Verbs of LIVING: notice, look, kneel nearby, wave open arms (no touch), run, stretch, point, clap, march, dance beside — not "stand" as a lyric
- BANNED physical contact words: hug, kiss, embrace, hold tight, wrap arms, snuggle, cuddle, squeeze, high-five, hand-hold, cheek, pull close, pull me close
- Complete every lyric line (never cut mid-sentence)
- Bedtime: bedroom only; soft words; no stomping/lawn
- NO zoo, ocean, space, pirates, jungle trips
- Max 6 words per finished line
- BANNED filler: thin, real neat, no trap, so bold, like a rabbit, happy snap, oh what a delight
- Cast: toddler hero (Adam). Mom (Sasha) may help when theme/lyrics need her. Prefer "I"/"my"; short Mom cues ("Mom kneels", "Mom waves") — never "Mom hugs"

Structure:
[Intro]     ← PROBLEM (stuck)
[Verse 1]   ← DISCOVERY (notice → try)
[Chorus]    ← FUN (build)
[Verse 2]   ← twist on same objective
[Chorus]    ← bigger FUN / peak
[Outro]     ← CELEBRATION (resolve)

Do NOT reuse these titles:

export const KIDS_HIT_SCENES_PROMPT = `You plan preschool music-video BEATS as a LIVED adventure — characters interacting through a chain, never a pose slideshow of standing in places.

North star: kids watch characters DO things TO each other. Every beat answers "what happens because of that?"

Continuity + living-story contract:
- ONE objective for the whole song: {{OBJECTIVE}}
- Cause → effect on EVERY beat (previous effect = this cause)
- Room changes need GOING there (exit / door / bridge) — never teleport
- Cuts need motivation: look, point, exit, object, match_action, energy
- Action phases across neighbors: setup → anticipate → action → react → followthrough → peak
- Each big move has wind-up AND settle (never run→hard cut with no react)
- Energy escalates: problem (soft) → discovery → fun → peak fun → celebration
- Visual rhythm: alternate short reaction / longer action / short joke / longer anticipation — not same length every shot
- Idle "business": characters never freeze — toddler bounces/rocks/looks; helper shifts weight/nods/tiny hands
- Emotion PROGRESSES (not flat smile): problem soft → discovery surprise/curious → fun happy → peak excited → celebration warm
- Reaction shots: when helper points/kneels/waves open arms, next beat shows toddler NOTICE → feel → respond
- Camera JOINS the story: lower when kneel, track when run/walk, push_in on find/laugh, close on reaction, pull_back / hold_wide on celebration
- Interaction field: short verb chain (e.g. "Mom kneels nearby → Adam looks up → Mom waves → Adam stretches")
- NO physical contact: never hug, kiss, embrace, hold, wrap arms, high-five, cheek-to-cheek, pull close — near-space social play only

Characters (cast-agnostic roles):
- Lead toddler (Adam) REQUIRED on every beat — drives the journey
- Helper Mom (Sasha) OPTIONAL (~1/3–1/2 of beats when lyrics/theme say Mom/help). Mom poses: stand, kneel, wave, point, hands_up, walk — never stomp/tiptoe/clap-dance
- Prefer INTERACTION over solo: notice → kneel nearby → look up → wave open arms → stretch → dance beside beats standing then waving alone
- Characters may stand NEAR each other mid-frame but bodies must NOT touch

Allowed locations (exact ids only):
{{LOCATIONS}}

Default location: {{DEFAULT_LOCATION}}
Mood: {{MOOD}}

Allowed cameras:
{{CAMERAS}}

Allowed poses:
{{POSES}}

Allowed expressions:
{{EXPRESSIONS}}

Song title: {{TITLE}}
Theme: {{THEME}}
Song duration seconds: {{DURATION_SEC}}

Lyrics:
{{LYRICS}}

Create EXACTLY between {{BEAT_MIN}} and {{BEAT_MAX}} beats covering 0 to {{DURATION_SEC}}.

HARD RULES:
- Each beat ONE frozen instant that advances the objective through ACTION or REACTION.
- BAN pose spam: no stand→wave→stand→smile loops. Prefer notice/kneel/stretch/clap/dance-beside chains.
- NEVER schedule hugs, kisses, embraces, or any body contact.
- Fields required on EVERY beat:
  storyBeat ("problem"|"discovery"|"fun"|"celebration"),
  cause, effect, interaction, lyricHint, startSec, endSec,
  cutMotivation, actionPhase, beatRole, cameraMotion, emotionIntensity (1-5),
  exitDir, enterDir,
  placement left|center|right per character, depth near|mid|far
- Intro=problem; Verse1=discovery; Chorus=fun (second chorus = peak energy); Verse2=fun twist; Outro=celebration
- Prefer 2–3 story rooms. Doorway/hallway only for travel (pipeline also inserts bridges).
- Bedtime: ALL bedroom.
- Pose matches lyric + escalating energy. tap→point NEVER tiptoe.
- Neighbor same pose → anticipate then action/followthrough (match_action).
- Same pose ≤2 times in a row.
- BOTH Adam+Sasha: Adam left/center, Sasha right — never same slot.
- SCREEN CONTINUITY (toddler is continuity lead):
  - Same room: keep Adam placement; NEVER left↔right teleport for variety
  - enterDir of beat N = opposite of exitDir of N-1 on room change
  - Facing front (or same) in-room; angle only when walking out
  - Indoor/raining objective: NEVER lawn destination
  - No room revisit without doorway reason; progressive journey only
